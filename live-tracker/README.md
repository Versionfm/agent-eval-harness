# Live tracker

Dedicated home for live observation and recorded playback of harness attempts. Status: **specification published** as [issue #10](https://github.com/Versionfm/agent-eval-harness/issues/10) with `ready-for-agent`. The production recorder/server/client are not implemented.

Read the [published tickets](docs/TICKETS.md), [specification](docs/SPEC.md), [design](docs/DESIGN.md), [learning sequence](docs/LEARNING_PLAN.md) and [decision interview](../docs/observability-interview.md). The disposable [layout prototype](../../harness-viewer-prototype.html?variant=A) is outside the production source tree. Its original builder/template and verdict are captured on local branch `prototype/live-tracker-layout` at `0024ce6243b62b31b2f6121758d2bbb0e9a44bb0`; this throwaway branch has not been pushed.

## Planned source layout

```text
live-tracker/
├── README.md
├── docs/
│   ├── DESIGN.md
│   └── LEARNING_PLAN.md
├── src/live_tracker/       # Python package: recorder, readers, server, integration
├── web/                   # TypeScript, HTML and CSS client
└── tests/                 # Recording, delivery, UI and integration verification
```

Only README and the design documents exist today. Source directories are created when their implementation tickets are approved; empty modules would not establish working behavior.

## Boundary

- `agent_eval_harness/` continues to own model/tool execution, both orchestrators, budgets, task environments and independent evaluation.
- `live-tracker/` owns incremental recording, reading/recovery, legacy adaptation, loopback delivery and the browser interface.
- A narrow injected event sink lets harness stages publish observable events. Instrumentation remains next to the stages it describes; browser/server imports stay out of the harness.
- Reports and playback read the same authoritative history. Integration adapts evidence to the existing report renderer without creating a second attempt runner or a separate UI-only log.
- Generated attempt evidence remains in configured evidence directories, separate from tracker source.

Python imports use `live_tracker`; `live-tracker` is the folder name. No move or rename of the existing harness code is required.
